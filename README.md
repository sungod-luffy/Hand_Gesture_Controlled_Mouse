# Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based mouse control system using computer vision. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and control the system cursor with simple gestures eliminating the need for traditional input devices like a mouse or trackpad.

✅ Features:

🎯 Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition

🖱️ Cursor movement based on index finger position

✊ Gesture-based click events (e.g., pinching for click)

🧩 No external sensors or hardware required—just a webcam

⚡ Highly responsive and intuitive interaction

♿ Enhances accessibility for differently-abled users

🛠 Tech Stack:

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, PyAutoGUI

Platform: Cross-platform (Windows / Linux)

Hardware: Standard HD webcam

💡 Use Cases:

🧼 Touchless control in hygiene-sensitive environments

👨‍🦽 Assistive technology for people with limited mobility

🏠 Smart home interfaces

🎮 Virtual and augmented reality interactions
